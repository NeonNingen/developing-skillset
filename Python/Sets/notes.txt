set_intro:
    A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements, they have a unique behaviour where elements cannot be duplicated
    If an element is duplicated in a set, it will make sure to remove it.
    Sets have uniqueness.

set_membership:
    Set membership determines whether a particular element exists within a set.
    If statements are usually used to check for a singular element.
    If you have multiple elements, we can use a function (like any) + generator expression (x in y for x in z)
    Keys in a dict are treated like sets because keys are unordered and unique.
    Set membership checks like these become very useful in data filtering or validation scenarios

set_mutability:
    Mutability refers to whether an object can be modified after its creation.
    Mutable object(s) can be altered while an immutable object(s) cannot.
    Sets fall under mutable therefore they can add, remove and update elements after a set is made.
    Python allows us to create immutable set using frozenset constructor.
    Error exception will be raised if you try to change the immutable set at all.
    Benefit of using immutable set is that the data remains stable and reliable.
    Mutable lists can have side effects and have data changes unexpectedly.

libmanagementchallenge:
    Create a library that contains books and the user needs to able to find the book they want.
    The code must return True or False (Boolean) regarding if the book is available or not.

union_intersecton:
    Union allows you to merge the contents of two sets without duplicating elements.
    The intersetion containts the most common elements between the two sets.
    Union merges can intelligently detect duplicated elements in either list and remove them from the final list.
